# Fire-Incidents
This report investigates the relationship between fire response times and socioeconomic status across Toronto's wards. Utilizing datasets from the City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal, the study aimed to discern if a significant difference in response times exists between higher-income and lower-income wards. Included in this repo are all the necessary starting materials to reproduce the study including:

- The original dataset
- Jupyter Notebook containing all code cells necessary to filter and perform analysis on dataset
- Code and files necesssary to generate choropleth maps

  
The goal of this report is to investigate and analyze the temporal relationship between fire alarm initiation time and arrival time of fire response units for fire incidents in many different wards of Toronto, with a specific focus on assessing whether there is asignificant difference in response times between wealthier and lower-income wards. However there is an opportunity to analyze more with this dataset including:
- Distances between incidents and fire stations
- Casualties by ward
- Income vs number of incidents and/or casualties
